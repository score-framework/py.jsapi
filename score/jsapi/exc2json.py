    Converts exception info (as returned by :func:`sys.exc_info`) into a
    3-tuple that can be converted into a json string by python's :mod:`json`
    library. It will consist of the exception name, the message and the stack
    trace as provided by :func:`traceback.extract_tb`::

        }

    It is possible to omit the last value of *excinfo*, effectively reducing
    the generated exception description to a class name and a message.

    The optional parameter *untrace* contains file names that will be removed
    from the beginning of the stack trace.
